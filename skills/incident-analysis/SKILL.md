# Incident Analysis

Tiered GCP log investigation and structured postmortem generation. Three stages: MITIGATE, INVESTIGATE, POSTMORTEM. Detects available tools at runtime and uses the best tier.

## Behavioral Constraints (Always Active)

### 1. HITL Gate — No Autonomous Mutations

If a mutating action is identified (restart service, rollback deployment, scale pods, modify config), you MUST present the exact command you intend to run and HALT completely. Wait for explicit user confirmation before executing. You are a copilot, not an autopilot.

### 2. Scope Restriction — No Global Searches During Incidents

During active investigation, all file reads, log queries, and code searches MUST be constrained to the specific service or trace ID identified in Stage 1 (MITIGATE). Global codebase searches (unbounded grep, recursive find) are forbidden. This prevents context window exhaustion and irrelevant noise during time-sensitive debugging.

### 3. Temp-File Execution Pattern (Tier 2 Only)

For any LQL query longer than 5 words or containing quotes/regex, write the query to a session-scoped temp file via `mktemp` and execute via file read. This avoids escaping failures and concurrent-session race conditions:

```bash
LQL_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/agent-lql-XXXXXX.txt)
cat > "$LQL_FILE" << 'QUERY'
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
AND resource.labels.service_name="checkout-service"
AND severity>=ERROR
AND timestamp>="2026-03-19T10:00:00Z"
QUERY

gcloud logging read "$(cat "$LQL_FILE")" \
  --project=my-project --format=json --limit=50 ; rm -f "$LQL_FILE"
```

The `;` operator ensures cleanup runs regardless of whether `gcloud` succeeds or fails. `mktemp` with a random suffix prevents concurrent sessions from overwriting each other's queries.

### 4. Context Discipline

When transitioning from INVESTIGATE to POSTMORTEM:
1. Write a synthesized summary of the timeline and root cause as an explicit output block
2. From that point forward, you are **strictly forbidden from referencing the raw JSON log outputs** from earlier in the conversation
3. Draft the postmortem **ONLY from the synthesized summary**
4. No further log queries or source code reads are permitted during POSTMORTEM

## Stage 1 — MITIGATE

### Step 1: Detect Available Tools

Determine the execution tier by checking what tools are available:

**Tier 1 — MCP (`@google-cloud/observability-mcp`):**
If you have access to `list_log_entries`, `search_traces`, `get_trace`, `list_time_series`, or `list_alert_policies` as MCP tools in this session, use Tier 1.

**Tier 2 — gcloud CLI via Bash:**
```bash
command -v gcloud && gcloud logging read --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "gcloud: available" || echo "gcloud: not available"
```
If gcloud is available but not authenticated, guide through `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`.

**Tier 3 — Guidance-only:**
If neither MCP tools nor gcloud are available, provide manual Cloud Console instructions (Logs Explorer URL patterns, filter syntax).

### Step 2: Establish Scope

Identify:
- Which service?
- Which environment (production, staging)?
- What time window? (default: last 30-60 minutes)

### Step 3: Query Error Rate / Recent Errors

Scoped to the identified service + narrow time window.

**Tier 1:** Use `list_log_entries` with LQL filter scoped to service + severity + time window, `page_size` <= 50.

**Tier 2:** Use the temp-file execution pattern (see Constraint 3) with `gcloud logging read` and `--limit=50`.

### Step 4: Identify Failing Request Pattern

Extract: endpoint, error code, frequency.

### Step 5: HITL Gate

If a mutating fix is obvious (restart, rollback, scale), present the exact command and HALT. Wait for explicit confirmation.

### Step 6: Transition

If a code fix is needed, transition to Stage 2 (INVESTIGATE).

## Stage 2 — INVESTIGATE

### Step 1: Query Logs with Narrowed Filter

Use LQL scoped to service + severity + time window identified in Stage 1.

### Step 2: Extract Key Signals

Stack traces, error messages, request IDs, trace IDs.

### Step 3: Single-Service Deep Dive

- Error grouping (frequency, first/last occurrence)
- Recent deployment correlation (deploy timestamp vs. error spike?)
- Resource metrics (CPU, memory, latency) if available

### Step 4: Multi-Service Trace Correlation (v1.1, Tier 1 Only)

If Tier 1 MCP tools are available:
- Extract trace IDs from log entries
- Use `search_traces` / `get_trace` to follow spans
- Query upstream/downstream service logs

### Step 5: Formulate Root Cause Hypothesis

### Step 6: Flight Plan

Before touching any code, output a bulleted list of:
- Files to modify
- Logic to change
- Expected outcome

Ask for explicit developer approval before proceeding.

### Step 7: Context Discipline — Synthesize

Write a synthesized summary of the timeline and root cause. From this point forward, reference ONLY this summary (not raw log JSON). See Constraint 4.

### Step 8: Transition to POSTMORTEM

## Stage 3 — POSTMORTEM

### Step 1: Template Discovery

Check in order:
1. `docs/templates/postmortem.md` (project convention)
2. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/postmortem.md` (GitHub-native)
3. Built-in default schema:

```
## 1. Summary
## 2. Impact (quantify user impact and duration)
## 3. Timeline (markdown table: timestamp | event)
## 4. Root Cause & Trigger
## 5. Resolution and Recovery
## 6. Lessons Learned (what went well, what went wrong, where we got lucky)
## 7. Action Items (actionable, assignable, with suggested owners)
```

### Step 2: Directory Discovery

Check for existing directory:
1. `docs/postmortems/` or `docs/incidents/` (check both)
2. Create `docs/postmortems/` if neither exists

### Step 3: Generate Postmortem

Generate from the synthesized summary (NOT raw logs):
- Title and metadata (date, service, severity)
- Timeline (from extracted timestamps, ordered)
- Impact (from error rates/metrics, quantified)
- Root cause (from investigation hypothesis)
- Action items (concrete, assignable, with suggested owners)

### Step 4: Write to Disk

Write to `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-case-summary>.md`

The summary portion MUST be lowercase kebab-case (e.g., `checkout-500s`, `auth-timeout-spike`). No spaces, no mixed casing.

### Step 5: Terminal Output

```
Postmortem saved to docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-case-summary>.md.
Review the document and action items.
```

## LQL Reference Patterns

| Pattern | LQL Filter |
|---------|-----------|
| Recent errors | `severity>=ERROR AND timestamp>="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"` |
| Cloud Run service | `resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="X"` |
| GKE pod errors | `resource.type="k8s_container" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="X"` |
| HTTP 5xx | `httpRequest.status>=500` |
| Trace correlation | `trace="projects/PROJECT/traces/TRACE_ID"` |
| Text search | `textPayload=~"pattern"` |
| JSON payload field | `jsonPayload.fieldName="value"` |

## Tier 1 MCP Tool Reference

| Investigation Step | MCP Tool | Parameters |
|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Query logs | `list_log_entries` | filter (LQL), project_id, page_size |
| Search traces | `search_traces` | filter, project_id |
| Get trace detail | `get_trace` | trace_id, project_id |
| Check metrics | `list_time_series` | filter, interval |
| Check alerts | `list_alert_policies` | project_id |

## Tier 2 gcloud CLI Reference

| Investigation Step | Bash Command |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Query logs | `gcloud logging read "$(cat "$LQL_FILE")" --project=X --format=json --limit=50` (see temp-file pattern) |
| List traces | `gcloud traces list --project=X --format=json` |
| Error events | `gcloud beta error-reporting events list --service=X --format=json` (beta) |
| Metrics | `gcloud monitoring metrics list --project=X --format=json` (limited) |
